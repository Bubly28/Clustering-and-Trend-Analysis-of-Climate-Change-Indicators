# Clustering-and-Trend-Analysis-of-Climate-Change-Indicators
This project, "Clustering and Trend Analysis of Climate Change Indicators," explores various climate change indicators for different countries using World Bank data. The study involves clustering techniques and data fitting models to identify patterns and make predictions.

Key aspects of the project include:

1. Data Clustering:
   - Utilized k-means clustering on normalized indicators such as GDP per capita, CO2 production per capita, and CO2 per GDP.
   - Visualized clusters and their centers with matplotlib, integrating cluster classifications into dataframes for further analysis.

2. Data Fitting and Modeling:
   - Applied simple models like exponential growth and low-order polynomials to fit time series data.
   - Used curve fitting to project future values, estimating confidence ranges with the `err_ranges` function and visualizing these projections.

3. Comparative Analysis:
   - Conducted comparative analysis within and across clusters, examining different climate change indicators.
   - Highlighted variations in trends among countries within the same cluster and between different clusters, providing insights into regional climate change impacts.

4. Poster Presentation:
   - Created a poster to present the findings, emphasizing concise text, self-contained graphs, and tables for effective communication.
   - Focused on visual storytelling with clear labels, legends, and meaningful titles to convey results at a glance.

This project demonstrates the effective application of clustering methods and data fitting techniques, combined with clear visual communication. The Python code adheres to PEP-8 guidelines and best practices, ensuring it is well-structured and maintainable.
